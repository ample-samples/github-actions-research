## Continous Integration (CI)
The practice of integrating all changes of your code into the main branch early and often, automatically testing each change and automatically building. 
    This means less errors and security issues that can be identified and fixed quickly.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
Automates infrastructure provisioning and application deploying process alonside CI.

## Summary
In other words, CI prepares the code for release, includes build and test, whereas CD is the actual release of code, includes release and deploy. Known as a CI/CD Pipeline. 
    
## CI/CD Pipeline...
is a streamlined method of testing and deployment of applications. This automates the application's release to its intended environment. This is important to improve quality of code and increase efficiency. 

## Benefits of CI/CD implementation
-  Happier users and customers 
-  Enhance code quality   
-  Recover Faster  
-  Continuous Feedback 
-  Reduces costs
